      Web design is my new area of interest. I am fascinated about coding.
      <br></br>
      I have other areas of interest such as photography or another recent one like canva design that I post using Intagram yet another new area to discover.
      <br></br>
      I am trying to learn how to apply my natural designer skills to coding. I am grateful to Thomas Scott and Ralph Cox for the opportunity to join the team work on web Garage where I could contribute with my sense of color, visual representation and idea conceptualization.
